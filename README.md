# Audio-Deep-Learning-Made-Simple-Sound-Classification
Audio Deep Learning Made Simple: Sound Classification, Step-by-Step. An end-to-end example and architecture for audio deep learningâ€™s foundational application scenario.

We will start with sound files, convert them into spectrograms, input them into a CNN plus Linear Classifier model, and produce predictions about the class to which the sound belongs.
