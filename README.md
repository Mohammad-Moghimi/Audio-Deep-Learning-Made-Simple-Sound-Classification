# Audio-Deep-Learning-Made-Simple-Sound-Classification
Audio Deep Learning Made Simple: Sound Classification, Step-by-Step. An end-to-end example and architecture for audio deep learningâ€™s foundational application scenario.

Sound Classification is one of the most widely used applications in Audio Deep Learning. It involves learning to classify sounds and to predict the category of that sound. This type of problem can be applied to many practical scenarios e.g. classifying music clips to identify the genre of the music, or classifying short utterances by a set of speakers to identify the speaker based on the voice.

In this project, we will walk through a simple demo application so as to understand the approach used to solve such audio classification problems. My goal throughout will be to understand not just how something works but why it works that way.

We will start with sound files, convert them into spectrograms, input them into a CNN plus Linear Classifier model, and produce predictions about the class to which the sound belongs.
